📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse & Analytics Portfolio Project 🚀
This repository presents an end-to-end implementation of a modern data warehousing and analytics solution. It covers the complete pipeline—from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights—following industry best practices in data engineering, modeling, and analytics.

This project is designed as a portfolio showcase for demonstrating real-world skills in data architecture, ETL development, and SQL-based analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

The project follows the Medallion Architecture, organized into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to ensure data quality, scalability, and analytical efficiency.

🔹 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)

Stores source data in its original form

Data ingested from CSV files into SQL Server

Represents ERP and CRM source systems

🔹 Silver Layer (Cleansed & Standardized)

Handles data cleansing, validation, and standardization

Resolves data quality issues

Prepares data for analytical consumption

🔹 Gold Layer (Business-Ready)

Contains curated datasets modeled using a star schema

Optimized for reporting and analytical queries

Serves as the final layer for BI and insights
